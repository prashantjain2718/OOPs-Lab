## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to the **OOPs-Lab** repository for the **B.Tech (AI & DS - Section B) 3rd Semester** (Academic Session 2025-26).

This repository is a comprehensive collection of all **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** laboratory programs, written in **C++**. It is designed to simplify and practically demonstrate core OOP concepts through hands-on, well-documented examples.

Each lab includes a clear **objective**, the complete **source code**, and **sample outputs** for reference and verification.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Complete Solutions:** Contains all required lab programs for the academic session.
* **Well-Documented:** Each program includes comments and a clear objective.
* **Ready to Run:** All code is tested and includes sample outputs.
* **Organized:** Structured by lab date for easy navigation.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To compile and run these programs, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your system.

* **GCC (g++)**
* **MinGW**
* Or any C++ IDE like **Visual Studio Code**, **Code::Blocks**, or **Dev-C++**.
